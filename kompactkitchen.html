            <i>Whitespace: </i> Lack of a full set of kitchen utensils for smaller kitchens with effective organization.

            <i>Project: </i> Design Thinking and Communication
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Solution: </i> The Kompact Kitchen is a concept which uses empty wall space to organize a full set of utensils on a magnetic board.

    <h2> I learnt to utilize virtual resources!</h2>
    <p>
      I learnt about manufacturing methods and setting competitive pricing. But the most importantly, I learnt how to communicate with my team. I was in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic while my team was in the US. I adapted to working remotely at all hours of the day (and especially night), and through good communication and by working hard to collaborate, we delivered a research document we were proud of!
