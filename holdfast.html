        <h1>Holdfast</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            <i>Problem: </i> Regular walkers can’t be pulled on to stand up without tipping over, which meant our client needed an additional person to help pull to stand.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Project: </i> Design Thinking and Communication, for the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Solution: </i> The Holdfast uses glass-lifting suction cups to allow the user to pull to stand without an additional helper.

        We narrowed the scope for a single user
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We interviewed user's physical therpaists (PTs) to understand that he used the walker at home and at the AbilityLab, narrowing our use environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          User finds it easier to pull than to push, therefore our solution must be stable enough to pull on.
        </li>
        <li>
          User weighs less than 200 lbs, 5x factor of safety recommended on medical devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Existing solutions were too heavy or bulky, others tipped over.

      <h2>
        The floors were smooth, why not suction cups?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I came up with the idea of using suction cups after we tested out weights, counter-balances, support structures, and more.
        They offered a light yet sturdy solution with 800 lbs of force that worked with the smooth floors of the AbilityLab and the user's room.

        A workable addition to our walker
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I coordinated with 3 other teams to make sure our attachment worked with the walker.
        </li>
        <li>
          The physical therapists approved the walker and the factor of safety was sufficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          User’s mother (primary caregiver) found operating the Holdfast more convenient.

    <h2> I learnt to design for specific needs.</h2>
    <p>
      I learnt about working with medical equipment and how failure modes and factors of safety should be approached. I also grew to appreciate how devices need to work for people with vastly different capabilities and requirements. I also developed an appreciation for inclusive design.
