    <h2> I learnt the value of scrappy prototyping!</h2>
    <p>
      I learnt about prototyping apps and different ways like roleplaying, Figma, or heatmap analysis to determine the functioning of the app. I also learnt a lot about features that apps commonly use that lack inclusivity towards neurodivergent people and simple practices like changing interface design or fonts that work better for a wider intersection of people.

        Defining our target users
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I conducted 16 interviews over the course of 5 weeks to determine exactly what problem we were solving. I learnt that starting tasks was the most challeneging part for many.
        </li>
        <li>
          User interviews expanded the scope of our problem to all people who struggled with holding attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          We chose to focus on people with ADHD as they had the most specific needs.

        Building on the best of existing solutions
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I analysed the benefits and drawbacks of existing solutions to create benchmarks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brainstormed ideas and conducted surveys to get feedback from users and other stakeholders like parents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a system model, interface model, and user model based on our research.

        Figma prototypes for user insight

          Evolved from paper prototypes to higher fidelity Figma prototypes
        </li>
        <li>
          Analysed risks imposed by prototypes, namely that human presence was an existing solution. Users forget or ignore reminders.
        </li>
        <li>
          I built in customizable reminders that users could define and we created a time recommendation system that learnt from users' habits.
