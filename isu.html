      <p>
        I collaborated with the mechanical team to find motors that worked with the required torque and speed to 
        work with the weight of the model and provide 2 G's of acceleration to the mock riders. We ended up using:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Arduino Uno
          </li>
          <li>
            Brushed DC motor, motor encoder, and motor driver
          </li>
          <li>
            Brushless motor (for greater torque and speed), brushless motor controller
          </li>
          <li>
            Batteries and power adapter
          </li>
        </ul>

        Designing the ride cycle
      </h2>
      <p>
        With a pause to simulate riders getting on and off, we designed the ride cycle combining elements of existing rides and our own fantasies!
        I also led the team to program the emergency stop and other functionalities of ride operation, in compliance with the 
        the American Society for Testing and Materials International standards.
