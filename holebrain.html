            <i>Problem: </i> COVID safety barriers are hard to hear across; ducking around them renders them ineffective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Project: </i> Human Centered Design
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Solution: </i> The Holebrain allows for 3.2x sound transmission with clarity and serve as an indicator of where to speak. It costs less than $10, 30 sec or shorter setup.

    <h2> I learnt to focus on users' feelings.</h2>
    <p>
      Not only about designing performance tests to see if the Holebrain was on spec or interview techniques for different stakeholders; but also about how users perceive the product’s features. It was crucial to understand users preferred colored cellophane over transparent as it made them feel safe and indicated where to speak.

          <li>
            I conducted AEIOU user observations, 5-Whys and user interviews which revealed that “the barrier is f---ing ridiculous!”

          <li>
            I interviewed stakeholders include baristas and retail employees, customers, sanitation workers to validate our observed problem.

          <li>
            I analyzed user journeys, personas for deeper insight into how users felt at different stages of using the existing solution.

            Finally, we benchmarked against alternatives to create metrics for determining success.

        Prototypes allowed us to get user feedback.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We designed and ran performance and user tests on three different prototypes to learn about which designs worked and how users interacted with them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our analysis revealed that users tended to touch some designs, while others which were completely transparent made them feel less safe.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some designs that a steeper learning curve in terms of set up and clean up durations.

        We designed performance tests.
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We needed a standardized way to test volume and clarity of audio transmission, so we created the "Hey, Siri!" Test 
          to record the number of time Siri responded across different prototypes.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also recorded decibel drops across different solutions my measuring time stamped data on either side of a conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both these analyses revealed that the Holebrain and one other design performed better than the remaining and better than plexiglass.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eventually, a combination of user feedback and performance test results showed that we had created a better solution to plexiglass barriers.
