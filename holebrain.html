            <i>Problem: </i> COVID safety barriers are hard to hear across;  ducking around renders them ineffective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Project: </i> Human centered design.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Solution: </i> The Holebrain allows for 3.2x sound transmission with clarity and serve as an indicator of where to speak. It costs less than $10, 30 sec or shorter setup.

            AEIOU user observations, 5-Whys and user interviews revealed “the barrier is f---ing rediculous!”

          <li>
            I interviewed stakeholders include baristas and employees, customers, sanitation workers to validate our observed problem.

          <li>
            I analysed user journeys, personas for deeper insight.

            We benchmarked against alternatives to create metrics for determining success.

    <h2> I learnt to focus on users' feelings.</h2>
    <p>
      Not only about designing performance tests to see if the Holebrain was on spec or interview techniques for different stakeholders; but also about how users perceive the product’s features. It was crucial to understand users preferred colored cellophane over transparent as it made them feel safe and indicated where to speak.
